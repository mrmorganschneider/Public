Readme file for Morgan Schneider's submission for the nike data analysis work

The run_analysis.R file requires the tidyverse library to be installed. 

The program will look for the UCI HAR Dataset in the local directory. If the directory is not found, the program will
download the appropriate dataset and unzip it to the local directory.

Afterwards, there should be no input required by the end user. The program will create the tidy_dataset.csv independently.
All that should need to be done by the user is to run the program.
