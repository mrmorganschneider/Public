Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 3979 using business_id
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

| Rachel        |            1 |    0 |

While there is not a strict linear correlation between number of reviews and the number of fans, as can be observed by the data above, posting few to no reviews leads to few fans.
This would indicate that posting more reviews leads to more fans overall.

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	love:1780 hate:232
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select count(text)
	from review
	where text like '%love%'

	select count(text)
	from review
	where text like '%hate%'
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select name,
	fans
	from user
	order by fans desc
	limit 10

	| Lissa     |  120 |
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City = "Peoria"

select distinct b.id,
b.name,
b.latitude,
b.longitude,
b.city,
c.category,
h.hours
from business as b 
left join category as c
on b.id = c.business_id
left join hours as h
on b.id = h.business_id
where b.city = 'Peoria'
and h.hours not like 'None'

Category = "Pizza"

select *
from business as b 
left join category as c
left join hours as h
where b.id = c.business_id
and b.id = h.business_id
and c.category = 'Pizza'
order by b.stars desc

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Peoria: No, hours are similar

Pizza: Yes, lower ratings have fewer hours and less consistent hour times

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Peoria: Yes, 22 and 9 respectively

Pizza: Yes, 129, 34, and 28
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

There does not appear to be any useful data derived from the location data comparison. Unless further details are provided,
there does not appear to be anything unique in the comparison between these two datasets

SQL code used for analysis:

select distinct b.id,
b.name,
b.latitude,
b.longitude,
b.city,
c.category
from business as b 
left join category as c
on b.id = c.business_id
left join hours as h
on b.id = h.business_id
where (b.city = 'Peoria' 
and c.category not like 'None')
or c.category = 'Pizza'
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

is_open is set to 0 for closed business' and 1 for open business'

select *
from business as b
left join hours as h
on b.id = h.business_id
group by b.is_open
         
ii. Difference 2:

closed locations are often referred to as "Closed" in the tip.text column. No open locations have this tip

select *
from business as b
left join tip as t
on b.id = t.business_id
where t.text not like 'None'
and t.text like '%losed%'
order by b.is_open
         
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I am going to try to predict the popularity of the city of Las Vegas on a monthly basis
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
For this task, I need to calculate the total number of reviews in the city of Las Vegas for each month. This will give me a rough idea of the number of reviews in Las Vegas for a given month.
To do this, I will need to parse the dates of the reviews and determine the month in whichthey were given. I will need to calculate this data for each month and add it to a single table for easy comparison. 
I will also need a method of sorting that makes comparison easy. To do this, I will add a user defined variable column to each to represent the month numerically for easy sorting.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
+-----------+-------+---------------------+-------+
| b.city    | count | r.date              | Month |
+-----------+-------+---------------------+-------+
| Las Vegas |    14 | 2015-01-19 00:00:00 |     1 |
| Las Vegas |    13 | 2017-02-24 00:00:00 |     2 |
| Las Vegas |    15 | 2015-03-31 00:00:00 |     3 |
| Las Vegas |    24 | 2011-04-23 00:00:00 |     4 |
| Las Vegas |    20 | 2014-05-19 00:00:00 |     5 |
| Las Vegas |    24 | 2013-06-06 00:00:00 |     6 |
| Las Vegas |    15 | 2016-07-30 00:00:00 |     7 |
| Las Vegas |    13 | 2013-08-03 00:00:00 |     8 |
| Las Vegas |    11 | 2016-09-20 00:00:00 |     9 |
| Las Vegas |    15 | 2013-10-14 00:00:00 |    10 |
| Las Vegas |    10 | 2015-11-25 00:00:00 |    11 |
| Las Vegas |    19 | 2015-12-06 00:00:00 |    12 |
+-----------+-------+---------------------+-------+

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select b.city,
count (b.city) as count,
r.date,
1 as Month
from business as b,
review as r
where b.id = r.business_id
and b.city = 'Las Vegas'
and r.date like '%-01-%'
group by b.city
union
select b.city,
count (b.city) as count,
r.date,
2 as Month
from business as b,
review as r
where b.id = r.business_id
and b.city = 'Las Vegas'
and r.date like '%-02-%'
group by b.city

--repeat above 6 more times

order by Month
